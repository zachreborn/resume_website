      </div>
      <div class="about-me content" id="about-me">
        <p>
          I am a transformational leader who believes that to be successful you
          must build your teams through empathy and trust. I do so by giving my
          team the 'why', autonomy, mastery, purpose, and leading from the
          front.
          <br /><br />
          My unique perspective on the interplay of technology and business
          comes from working with organizations of all sizes and growth stages.
          These organizations have ranged from 10+ to 6000+ employees. I've seen
          what great teams and technology look like over my 20 year career
          throughout many industries. This experience has helped me to focus on
          what matters most when building teams and technology.
          <br /><br />
          I get my own joy and purpose from working with leadership teams which
          exhibit excellence in key qualities:<br />
          - Willingness to be vulnerable and open<br />
          - Eagerness for continuous improvement<br />
          - A growth mindset<br />
          - Collaboration and inclusivity<br />
          <br />
          I come from a history of playing team sports. Sports taught me the
          value in lifting up those around you. The power of confidence and
          positive thinking in any one member of a team can spread like wildfire
          and allow for impressive feats, previously thought impossible. In that
          same way, failure is something a team bears the burden of together. A
          single play resulting in a loss may have been what sticks in one's
          memories, but it was the team that brought that play to be. Failure is
          merely a learning opportunity put forth right in front of your eyes. A
          guidepost pointing you and the team towards continuous improvement.
          <br /><br />
          Interestingly, I'm just as comfortable delivering a presentation to a
          board as I am rolling up my sleeves writing code behind the scenes. I
          never stray too far from my roots as a network engineer: doodling a
          topology diagram on whiteboard, organizing thoughts and ideas on my
          tablet, and unpacking the nitty gritty details of a technology. By
          putting a piece of technology within my hands I can turn it around and
          view it from all angles. Doing so helps me to understand how it can be
          placed within a larger cohesive system.
          <br /><br />
          In many ways I'm like a star in the galaxy. I naturally pull a strong
          team together around me. To me, the best experience is working with a
          team who builds things together. Hands on, constantly improving
          everything we touch.

        <h3><span class="dot">.</span>Technology Philosophy</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="philosophy content" id="philosophy">
        <h4>Simple</h4>
        <p>
          Technology should make our lives simpler, not harder. People follow
          the path of least resistance, and that means complexity or difficulty
          leads to ineffective technology. Don't settle for technology that
          solves one problem but creates another. Utilize the right technology
          to create efficiency and simplicity.
        </p>
        <h4>Secure</h4>
        <p>
          Security must be so interwoven into technology that it is
          indiscernible from the technology itself. It should be a cornerstone
          for all design and architecture decisions. Security is not a feature
          that can be added later; it must be built in from the start.
        </p>
        <h4>Transparent</h4>
        <p>
          Technology should be well-documented and communicated to describe how
          it works. The most utilized technologies are those which are plainly
          written, diagrammed, and described. Doing so allows others to use the
          technology as a building block.
        </p>
        <h4>Automated</h4>
        <p>
          If it isn't automated, it isn't true. We're all human, and any mundane
          process is prone to error. Automation of the mundane and the boring
          solves problems and common mistakes such as typos or entering data
          into the wrong field. It allows people to focus on higher-level
          projects, innovation, and growth.
        </p>
        <h4>Redundant and Resilient</h4>
        <p>
          Technology should be scalable and built for failure. Scalability
          considered both expansion and contraction. Failure can exist at any
          layer and when the design of technology accounts for failure that
          allows for continuity. It is the difference between stressful
          firefighting and confidence in knowing the technology will work when
          needed.
